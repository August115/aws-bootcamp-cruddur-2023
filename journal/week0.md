This week served as a bootcamp overview and introduction to cloud spend. After a review of the project, business use-case and AWS services, we were left with guides for the following tasks: 
- [x] watch spend and security videoes
- [x] recreate the conceptual diagram
- [x] recreate the logical architectural diagram
- [x] create an admin user
- [x] use CloudShell
- [x] generate AWS credentials
- [x] install AWS CLI
- [x] create a billing alarn

Below the work for some of the above tasks are shown as well as the creation of an IAM role and setting MFA.
